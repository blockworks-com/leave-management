# leave-management
A system to keep track of users' leave. Users will be allotted a certain number of days per year and then both vacation/holidays and sick will be tracked. Also allow users to enter other leave , like paternity, jury duty, etc. A list of allowed public holidays will be maintained so if the user is on leave during a public holiday, it doesn't count against them.
